[BotPack] is a modified messenger bot file by [Max Spencer] It is a refined version of the Mirai messenger bot, with some unique enhancements. 

A key feature is the `usePrefix` function integrated within every command. This function removes the need for prefixes, providing a more streamlined user experience. Alongside ready-made commands and free-to-edit codes, this bot file encourages users to learn and explore freely.
